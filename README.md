# NOVA-Pharmacy-DBMS
 Designed a relational database using ER modeling and normalization. Implemented core features using SQL and PL/SQL to manage patients, prescriptions, and contracts.
A production-aware Oracle PL/SQL schema for a Pharmacy Database Management System. This repository contains the DDL and PL/SQL code that implements secure user authentication, audit logging, inventory management, prescription processing, insurance claims, and safety features such as drug-interaction checks, automatic reorders, concurrency protections, and data integrity constraints.

DESIGN GOALS

Security

Per-user salt + system pepper model for password hashing using DBMS_CRYPTO (SHA-256).

Password policy enforcement (minimum length and basic complexity).

Mapping from DB session to application user via a helper in sec_pkg (adaptable to application context).

Avoid storing plaintext credentials.

Auditability

Central Audit_Log table capturing operation type, record identifier, summaries for old/new values, user id, IP address and timestamp.

Audit triggers for sensitive tables write CHANGED_BY as the mapped System_Users.USER_ID and capture SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','IP_ADDRESS') where available.

Audit summaries are deliberately compact (limited VARCHAR2 fields) to avoid unbounded CLOB growth.

Data integrity

Referential integrity across entities (patients, doctors, drugs, pharmacies, contracts, prescriptions).

Canonical ordering and uniqueness for drug interactions to avoid symmetric duplicates.

Identity columns (GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY) for surrogate keys and Prescription.PNO.

Unique constraints for licenses and other business-critical fields.

Operational safety

Triggers and procedures do not issue COMMIT — the caller controls transaction boundaries to preserve atomicity and enable correct rollback behavior.

Reorder automation triggers on both INSERT and UPDATE, configurable reorder quantity per stock row.

Concurrency protections (row-level SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) for refill processing and claim handling.

Validations preventing critical drug interactions and over-dispensing.

Package overview

sec_pkg — security helpers:

g_pepper — application-level pepper constant (must be secured).

gen_salt() — generates a 16-byte salt.

hash_with_salt(pw, salt) — returns SHA-256 of salt || password || pepper.

validate_password_policy(password) — enforces minimal password requirements.

get_current_user_id() — maps database session user to System_Users.USER_ID (adaptable to application context variable).

Important operational notes

Run environment

Oracle Database supporting DBMS_CRYPTO and IDENTITY columns (Oracle 12c+ recommended).

Execute the full script as a single file in SQL Developer, SQL*Plus / SQLcl, Oracle APEX SQL Workshop, or Oracle Live SQL.

Privileges

The executing schema needs rights to create tables, indexes, packages, triggers, and procedures.

Transaction handling

No COMMIT statements are present inside stored procedures or triggers. After invoking DML procedures the application or DBA script must COMMIT or ROLLBACK explicitly.

Pepper management

sec_pkg.g_pepper is present in the package for convenience. For production you must:

Replace the placeholder with a secure value.

Preferably store pepper in an external secrets vault and inject into the session or use a secure mechanism rather than keeping it in source control.

Session user mapping

sec_pkg.get_current_user_id() maps SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV','SESSION_USER') to System_Users.USERNAME. In many application setups the DB session user will not equal the application username. For best practice:

Set an application context with the current USER_ID at login (e.g., DBMS_SESSION.SET_CONTEXT), and modify sec_pkg.get_current_user_id() to read that context.

Alternatively ensure the application uses a proxy or distinct DB session for each application user and the DB session username matches System_Users.USERNAME.

Testing

Always deploy first to a development environment.

Use the provided test_data.sql (or request one) to validate:

User creation and authentication.

Audit entries include CHANGED_BY and IP_ADDRESS.

Drug interaction blocking for severe/critical interactions.

Auto-reorder request creation on INSERT and UPDATE.

Refill processing with concurrency protection.

Backup and rollback

Keep a DDL export and a drop_all.sql cleanup script for clean redeployment cycles.

If the schema already contains objects from previous versions, drop or rename conflicting objects before applying the script.

How to deploy

Open your SQL client connected to the target schema.

Run the script:

SQL Developer: paste into a worksheet and Run Script (F5) or run @schema_v2_3.sql.

SQL*Plus / SQLcl: @/path/to/schema_v2_3.sql.

After deployment, compile packages/procedures if any are invalid:

SELECT object_name, object_type, status FROM user_objects WHERE status = 'INVALID';


Create initial system users via create_user(...) and COMMIT.

Basic usage examples

Create an application user (example; remember to COMMIT after calling):

BEGIN
  create_user(
    p_user_id => 'user-0001',
    p_username => 'app_user',
    p_password => 'Secur3Pass',
    p_role => 'PHARMACIST',
    p_created_by => NULL
  );
END;
/
COMMIT;


Authenticate a user:

DECLARE
  v_result NUMBER;
  v_user_id VARCHAR2(36);
  v_role VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN
  authenticate_user('app_user', 'Secur3Pass', v_result, v_user_id, v_role);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Result=' || v_result || ' User=' || v_user_id || ' Role=' || v_role);
END;
/


Add a prescription (returns generated PNO in an OUT parameter; caller must COMMIT):

DECLARE
  v_pno NUMBER;
BEGIN
  add_prescription(
    p_pno => v_pno,
    p_p_date => SYSDATE,
    p_quantity => 10,
    p_d_aadhar_id => 'D12345678901',
    p_p_aadhar_id => 'P12345678901',
    p_trade_name => 'Paracetamol',
    p_dno => 1,
    p_dosage => '1 tablet twice daily',
    p_duration => 5,
    p_refills => 1
  );
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('New PNO: ' || v_pno);
END;
/
COMMIT;

Testing checklist

Create one System_Users account and verify authenticate_user.

Insert two Drug rows and create a critical Drug_Interactions entry; try creating a prescription that would trigger the interaction — it should be blocked.

Insert Pharmacy_Stock with quantity below MIN_STOCK_LEVEL; verify Reorder_Requests is created (audit entry logged) on INSERT.

Simulate concurrent process_refill calls (two sessions) and confirm row locks prevent over-dispensing.

Submit and process an insurance claim; ensure approval and rejection rules are enforced.

Extensibility & production recommendations

Move g_pepper out of the package and use a secure secrets manager.

Use DBMS_SESSION/application context to reliably set the current USER_ID in each session.

Consider moving detailed audit payloads to an append-only log storage (external log system) if you need full row-level snapshots.

Harden password policy (length, symbol requirements, expiration) and implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts.

Add role-based database proxies or application-level authorization to reduce reliance on session-user mapping.
